# ID-Year-Detect-for-Engineering-Students-(e.g.-1st-year-2nd-year-3rd-year-4th-year)

In our college students are having various band colors for their ID card. 

1) Brown for 1st year student
2) Green for 2nd year student
3) Blue for 3rd year student
4) Yellow for 4th(final year) student

This project uses Computer Vision techniques to detect the band color of the student and after detecting the band color, it can tell the student is in which year of its Engineering.
